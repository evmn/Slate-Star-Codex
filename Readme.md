# Slate Star Codex

Vitalik Buterin, the creater of Ethereum, highly praised **Slate Star Codex** in a 2019 dialogue with **Late Post**, he said **it's informative,  feels like 5 books**.

In Twitter, Vitalik Buterin, Pual Graham and Elon Musk are following the author of this blog—[Scott Alexander](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex).

I've read two posts(**TL;DR**) about competition, I think a lot of people will be interested.

 - [Meditations On Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)
 - [Studies On Slack](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/12/studies-on-slack/)

I will quote a line from **Studies On Slack** to explain the difference from *Moloch* and *Slack*:

>In the esoteric teachings, total competition is called Moloch, and total absence of competition is called Slack.

There are over 1500 blogs in the archives，I've filtered out a lot with the following regex.
